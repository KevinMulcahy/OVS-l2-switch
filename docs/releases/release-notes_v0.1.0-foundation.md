# Release Notes — v0.1.0-foundation

**Release Date:** 2025-10-06  
**Tag:** `v0.1.0-foundation`  
**Status:** ✅ Approved (Phase 1 Completion)  
**Repository:** https://github.com/<your-org>/OVS-l2-switch  

---

## 1. Overview

This release marks the completion of **Phase 1: Foundations**, delivering the initial architecture, build system, and CI/CD automation for the Open-Source Layer 2 Switching Platform.  

Phase 1 establishes a functional baseline capable of compiling, testing, and performing basic dataplane-to-control-plane communication, while ensuring full compliance with the AIBD-RG development and documentation standards.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Implement foundational project structure (Rust dataplane + Go controlplane).  
- Enable automated CI/CD pipelines with linting, security audit, and integration testing.  
- Provide Docker Compose environment for local and CI execution.  
- Deliver comprehensive documentation (README, INSTALL, ROADMAP, PRD).  

Reference: [`docs/phase1_prd.md`](../phase1_prd.md)

## 3. Key Features

| Component | Feature | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **Dataplane (Rust)** | Basic packet forwarding | Packets entering one interface are emitted on another using Linux networking stack |
| **Control Plane (Go)** | Healthcheck service | HTTP endpoint on port 8080 verifying service readiness |
| **CI/CD Pipelines** | Fast checks | Format, lint, unit test, and security audit in parallel |
| | Integration tests | Validates dataplane/controlplane container startup and health |
| | Fuzz smoke tests | Runs cargo-fuzz against Ethernet parsing logic |
| **Tooling** | Makefile + Docker Compose | Unified build/test automation for developers and CI |

---

## 4. Validation Summary

| Category | Tool / Method | Result |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **Formatting** | `cargo fmt`, `go fmt` | ✅ Passed |
| **Linting** | `clippy`, `golangci-lint` | ✅ Passed (0 warnings) |
| **Testing** | `cargo test`, integration tests | ✅ Passed |
| **Security** | `cargo audit` | ✅ No vulnerabilities detected |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions (fast-checks, integration-tests, fuzz-smoke) | ✅ All workflows succeeded |

---

## 5. Artifacts

| Type | Location / Command |
|------|--------------------|
| Docker images | `ovs-l2-switch-controlplane` / `ovs-l2-switch-dataplane` |
| Git tag | `v0.1.0-foundation` |
| Documentation | `docs/phase1_prd.md`, `README.md`, `INSTALL.md`, `ROADMAP.md` |
| CI Workflow | `.github/workflows/rust-ci.yml` |

---

## 6. Known Limitations (Deferred to Phase 2+)

- No MAC learning, VLAN tagging, or STP logic (Phase 2).  
- No REST or gRPC APIs (Phase 3).  
- No CLI or GUI management (Phase 4).  
- No DPDK/eBPF acceleration (Phase 5).  

---

## 7. Compliance Mapping

| AIBD-RG Section | Evidence |
|-----------------|-----------|
| §1 Project Structure | Modular Rust / Go repositories |
| §2 Architecture Guidelines | Clear separation of dataplane and controlplane |
| §4 Code Style | Rustfmt + Clippy + GolangCI-Lint clean |
| §6 Testing Guidelines | Unit + Integration + Fuzz coverage |
| §8 CI/CD Integration | Automated workflows validated |
| §9 Security & Compliance | cargo-audit clean; containers run as non-root |
| §10 Anti-Pattern Avoidance | Verified no cyclic dependencies or unsafe code |
